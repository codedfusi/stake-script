# stake-larp

A tiny userscript to LARP your balance on [stake.com](https://stake.com) — replaces `ARS` with `$` and updates the peso icon to a USD one, so you can fake wealth.

# ⚠️ Stake.com vs Stake.us

This script is currently untested on stake.us, but works fine on stake.com.

## 🌀 What It Does

- Larps `"ARS"` Currency and changes it to `USD` or `"$"` across the site
- Also larps currency icons
- Keeps doing it even if the site re-renders (React-safe)

## 🛠 Install

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/)
2. Add the script manually or use the greasyfork script heh: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/543536-you-should-call-me-kawaii-lay-it-like-a-hentai-e-3-3
3. Visit `stake.com`
4. Change your fiat currency to `ARS` in `BALANCE -> WALLET SETTINGS`
5. Click `ARS` or `$` if you have the script on already.
